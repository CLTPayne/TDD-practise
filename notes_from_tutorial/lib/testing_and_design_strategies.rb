Story:
As a student
So that I can pay attention to my motivation
I want an IRB application that stores my motivation ratings

Imagining how the software that solves this should look:
> track_motivation(5)
=> "Motivation stored!"
> show_motivations
=> [5]
> track_motivation(6)
=> "Motivation stored!"
> show_motivations
=> [5, 6]
